To run Zql:
===========

java org.gibello.zql.ZqlParser

(the classpath has to point on the ZQL jar file,
eg. zql-parser/target/zql-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar).

If you have a source release of Zql:
====================================

1) To generate the parser

Maven is required, and the Zql build uses the JavaCC maven plugin.

To build zql:
mvn clean install

2) Source files

The javacc grammar lies in the zql-parser/src/main/javacc directory.

In the src/main/java directory, you will find:
- The org/gibello/zql directory contains the sources for the Zql API classes.
- The org/gibello/zql/data directory contains the sources for the basic
expression evaluator that comes with Zql (used in the Zql demo).

3) To generate the doc

mvn javadoc:javadoc

The doc is then generated in zql-parser/target/site/apidocs .
