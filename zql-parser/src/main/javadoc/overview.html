<h2>What is Zql ?</h2>

Zql is a SQL parser written in Java.<br>

Zql parses SQL and fills in java structures representing SQL statements and
expressions.<p>

Zql can parse all the queries given as examples in the following
<a href="doc-files/sqltut.html">SQL tutorial</a> (a now old version of
<a href="http://www.dbbm.fiocruz.br/class/Lecture/d17/sql/jhoffman/sqltut.html">James Hoffman's SQL tutorial</a>).<p>

An SQL expression evaluator comes with Zql, so you can easily evaluate
SQL expressions out of the parser.<br>

<h2>Warning: No warranty !</h2>

Zql is no commercial product (license: GNU GPLv3).
Feel free to use it, but we provide no warranty.<br>
Zql APIs may be subject to changes, to enrich functionalities or fix bugs.<p>

<h2>How to use Zql ?</h2>

<li>
Make your CLASSPATH variable point on the zql jar file.
</li>
<li>
Type <code>java org.gibello.zql.ZqlParser</code>, then some SQL statements (like
<code>select * from customer;</code>) to make sure Zql is properly installed.
</li>
<li>
The Zql source code comes with some examples and tests, so you can discover how to leverage Zql to write your own SQL application!
</li>
</ul>

<h2>More details</h2>

The parser itself is written with
<a href="https://javacc.dev.java.net">JavaCC</a>, a Java parser generator (like
Unix's popular yacc generator).<p>

It takes as input SQL statements (select, insert, update, delete, commit,
rollback, set transaction), and fills in Java structures that represent the
statements it parsed.<p>

Example:<br>
<code>
SELECT ANTIQUEOWNERS.OWNERLASTNAME, ANTIQUEOWNERS.OWNERFIRSTNAME<br>
FROM ANTIQUEOWNERS, ANTIQUES<br>
WHERE ANTIQUES.BUYERID = ANTIQUEOWNERS.OWNERID AND ANTIQUES.ITEM = 'Chair';<br>
</code>
<p>

Will result in a ZqlQuery structure.<br>
ZqlQuery's getSelect(), getFrom() and getWhere() methods will extract the
SELECT, FROM and WHERE parts of the query.<br>

<ul>
<li>
getSelect() will return a Vector of ZSelectItem, data structures that give
information about the columns and/or operations requested (including
SQL expression support, like in <code>SELECT a+b FROM num;</code>).<br>
</li>
<li>
getFrom() will return a Vector of ZFromItem, data structures that give
information about the tables involved in the query.<br>
</li>
<li>
getWhere() will return an SQL expression, a data structure that represents
<code>ANTIQUES.BUYERID = ANTIQUEOWNERS.OWNERID AND ANTIQUES.ITEM = 'Chair'
</code> in the example above (the expression evaluator that comes with
Zql can evaluate such expressions, for a given data tuple).<p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some history...</h2>
The 1st release of SQL came to the net on March 10... 1998 (!).<br/>
After a long proprietary life, I finally decided to open the code,
in september 2010.<br/>
In the meantime, some bugs were fixed and some enhancements added, most of
them minor. Note I haven't been working a lot on Zql since the 1st release,
and most of the work was finished in late 2002.<br/>
Zql was re-packaged for maven in 2014.<br/>
