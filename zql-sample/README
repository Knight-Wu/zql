Zql sample code
===============

Note: prior to running any sample code, the classpath has to point on the ZQL
jar file, eg. ../zql-parser/target/zql-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar .

The sample code is divided in 2 packages:

1) org.gibello.zql.sample.api: contains some source code that demonstrates
the use of Zql APIs.

Here... the code is the doc !

2) org.gibello.zql.sample.data: shows how Zql can be used to manipulate data
and evaluate expressions.

The data demo comes with 2 "database" files: num.db and contact.db, and 2
"queries" files: queries.num and queries.contact (in datafiles/ directory).

They are text files: num.db is a list of numbers, contact.db a list of contacts
with names and e-mails.
The data demo allows to query those two files in SQL: queries are very simple
(no joins, no aggregate functions):
you can have a look at queries.num or queries.contact, they contain query
examples.

To run the data demo:

java org.gibello.zql.sample.data.ZDataDemo

then send queries like "select * from num;", etc...

You can also run the demo with the sample queries:
java org.gibello.zql.sample.data.ZDataDemo queries.num
 or
java org.gibello.zql.sample.data.ZDataDemo queries.contact
